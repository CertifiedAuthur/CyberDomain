# Project README: PDF Processing and Information Retrieval
### Overview
This project involves the processing of PDF documents to extract text, generate embeddings, and implement an advanced information retrieval system using Pinecone. 
The workflow includes loading PDF files, merging them, extracting text, creating embeddings using OpenAI's models, and employing various techniques for querying the indexed data.
